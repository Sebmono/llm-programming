---

## 2025-08-22
### New Features
- **Prediction Object Support**: DSPy now recognizes and handles `Prediction` objects passed as input, automatically piping them to underlying LM calls when in the expected format. (commit 2ac7756)
- **Per-Module History Inspection**: Added an `inspect_history` method and history tracking per module, enabling users to view conversation histories with timestamps and message details in both sync and async workflows. (commit 1e8d3e2)
- **Google Cloud Storage Images**: `dspy.Image` now accepts `gs://` URIs, allowing users to load images directly from Google Cloud Storage. (commit 7c68c08)
- **LangChain Tool Integration**: Introduced support for converting LangChain tools into `dspy.Tool` objects, streamlining tool invocation workflows. (commit 23d0e891)
- **CodeAct Module**: Added a new `CodeAct` module for integrated code generation, execution, and interpretation within DSPy programs, complete with tests. (commit 4ea5041)
- **Custom Module Serialization**: Enabled value-based serialization of user-defined modules via a new `modules_to_serialize` parameter, registering them with `cloudpickle`. (commit bc61653)
- **Building AI Agents Tutorial**: Published a tutorial on creating autonomous agents using DSPy's ReAct architecture, including a complete flight-booking agent example. (commit 99d0e706)
- **MLflow Optimization Tutorial**: Added a tutorial demonstrating MLflow setup, trace logging, and analysis for DSPy optimization workflows. (commit f9c85e68)

### Enhancements
- **Global Error Threshold**: Introduced a `max_errors` setting across DSPy to globally configure how many errors can occur before halting operations. (commit 19d846a)
- **PythonInterpreter Sandbox Controls**: Enhanced the `PythonInterpreter` class with granular sandbox permissions—file access, environment variables, and network controls—and support for custom interpreter instances. (commit 5bc4a15)
- **Python 3.13 & 3.14 Support**: Updated DSPy’s version requirements to support Python 3.13 and allow Python 3.14, including associated test fixes. (commit b5d66a6)

### Bug Fixes
- **DataLoader.from_parquet**: Fixed input-key expansion by passing keys as positional arguments rather than as a list. (commit 6945344)
