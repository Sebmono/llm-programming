## 2025-08-11 (v3.0.0b4)

### New Features
- Introduced the GRPO (Generative Reinforcement Policy Optimization) training module, enabling experimental reinforcement-learning workflows with data bootstrapping, checkpointing, and validation.
- Added `BaseType` support to `dspy.signatures`, letting users define and parse custom types (e.g., nested images or other rich content) in both chat and JSON adapters.
- Introduced a new `Audio` primitive (`dspy.Audio`) supporting file paths, URLs (including `gs://`), NumPy arrays, and Base64 strings for audio data.
- Added `XMLAdapter` and XML support in `StreamListener` for parsing and formatting XML-structured data in streaming and batch modes.
- Defined a new `Code` primitive type (`dspy.Code`) for code generation and analysis, with adapter support for markdown code blocks.
- Launched `dspy.syncify`, a synchronous wrapper for asynchronous DSPy modules, enabling async programs to run in sync contexts.
- Added BAMLAdapter, a custom structured-output adapter that generates human-readable schemas for nested Pydantic models, with support for recursive types and comments.
- Recognized `gpt-5` as a reasoning model option with default token and temperature settings validated.

### Enhancements
- Increased the default `max_tokens` limit in LM clients from 1000 to 4000 and now emit warnings when responses are truncated.

### Bug Fixes
- Introduced the `AdapterParseError` exception in JSON and chat adapters to surface parsing failures with clearer, more actionable error messages.
