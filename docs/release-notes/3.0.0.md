## 2025-08-12 (v3.0.0)

### New Features
- Added support for GPT-5 as a new reasoning model (requires â‰¥20,000 tokens, temperature = 1.0).
- Introduced dspy.Audio and dspy.Code types for audio data and code snippets, with serialization and language specification.
- Introduced XMLAdapter for parsing and formatting XML-based data in DSPy pipelines.
- Added PEP 604 union syntax (e.g., `int | None`) in inline type signatures for concise annotations.
- Introduced CodeAct module for combined code interpretation and programmatic reasoning with tool execution support.
- Integrated LangChain tools via `dspy.from_langchain` and added `ToolCalls.format` for OpenAI-compatible tool-call serialization.
- Added `dspy.syncify` utility to convert asynchronous modules into synchronous variants.
- Introduced GEPA optimizer for inference-time batch prompt evolution, including classes, metrics, and evaluation workflows.
- Added global `max_errors` configuration to customize error limits across DSPy operations.
- Added `dspy.configure_cache` API for fine-grained LM call caching configuration.
- Supported serializing custom modules via cloudpickle in program saving.
- Supported passing predicted output data directly into the DSPy prediction framework.

### Enhancements
- Replaced the `Program` class with `Module` across the API; updated imports and type annotations accordingly.
- Dropped Python 3.9 support; DSPy now requires Python 3.10+ (compatible through 3.14) and made pandas, datasets, and optuna optional dependencies.
- Switched the default Databricks provider model to `llama-4` and added service-principal authentication support.
- Improved history inspection output with `pretty_print_history` and added display of audio entries.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `DataLoader.from_parquet` to correctly expand input keys as arguments.
- Fixed `ReinforceJob` to assign the provided LM instance rather than the class.
- Fixed asymmetric merging in usage entries to preserve keys present only in the first entity.
- Fixed JSONAdapter fallback to propagate errors correctly instead of swallowing exceptions.
- Fixed CSV dataset loader to use a temporary file for better test isolation and reliability.
