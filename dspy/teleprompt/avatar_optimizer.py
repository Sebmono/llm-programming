### New Features
- **AvatarOptimizer**: Introduced `AvatarOptimizer`, a specialized feedback-driven teleprompter for optimizing tool-using agent programs. It iteratively evaluates the agent on task data, collects positive and negative samples, synthesizes LM-generated feedback, and updates agent instructions to improve performance. Built-in mechanisms for sampling, comparison, and LM-based instruction revision are provided for tool pipelines and multi-step workflows.
